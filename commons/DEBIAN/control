Description: SMS Gateway
 Jasmin is a very complete open source SMS Gateway with many enterprise-class
 features such as:
 .
  - SMPP Client / Server
  - HTTP Client / Server
  - Console-based configuration, no service restart required
  - Based on AMQP broker for store&forward mechanisms and other queuing systems
  - Using Redis for in-memory DLR tracking and billing
  - Advanced message routing/filtering
  - Web and console ui for management
  - Supports Unicode (UTF-8) for sending out multilingual SMS
  - Supports easy creation and sending of specialized/binary SMS

 Jasmin relies heavily on message queuing through message brokers
 (Using AMQP), it is designed for performance, high traffic loads and full
 in-memory execution.
